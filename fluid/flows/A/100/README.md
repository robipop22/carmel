## A100: Chris visits the Carmel website.

- 1. The main site is ```carmel.io```
- 2. The site has ```https``` enabled 
- 3. The ```https``` is the main default redirect
- 4. So ```carmel.io```, ```http://carmel.io``` both go to ```https://carmel.io```
- 5. The site also supports the ```www.carmel.io``` redirect
